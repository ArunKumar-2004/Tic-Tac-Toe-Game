# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
This code is a Python implementation of a Tic Tac Toe game, where the user can play against another player or against the computer. The code includes functions for displaying the rules of the game, asking the players for their names and their choice of symbol, randomly selecting which player goes first, displaying the game board, asking the player for their move, checking if the game has been won, and announcing the winner.

The code also includes an additional function for the computer player, where it chooses the optimal move to play against the user. The computer player first checks if it can win the game with its next move, then checks if it needs to block the user's potential winning move, then plays on one of the open corners, then the center square, and finally on one of the open edges.
